# Exercises

## Week 1

1. What tools (or techniques) do you use to write?
2. How do these tools shape the way you write (e.g., constrain the way you write or facilitate your writing)?

**Note:** As part of the folio for the end of the semester I want you to continue to revisit these questions as you work through class exercises or on your major digital writing work.

1. Create a constraint and write a short work using that constraint
2. Create an algorithm or process and create a short work using that process
3. [Remix a digital poem](remix-a-digital-poem.md)
